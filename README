DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::RSS is a POE component that alerts
    newly uploaded CPAN distributions. It obtains this information from
    polling an RSS feed ( by default <http://search.cpan.org/uploads.rdf>.

    POE::Component::RSSAggregator is used to handle the RSS feed monitoring
    and POE::Component::Client::HTTP used to obtain the full author path for
    each new upload.

CONSTRUCTOR
    "spawn"
        Takes a number of parameters:

          'event', the event handler in your session where each new upload alert should be sent, mandatory;
          'session', optional if the poco is spawned from within another session;

        The 'session' parameter is only required if you wish the output
        event to go to a different session than the calling session, or if
        you have spawned the poco outside of a session.

        Returns an object.

METHODS
    "session_id"
        Returns the POE::Session ID of the component.

    "shutdown"
        Terminates the component.

INPUT EVENTS
    "shutdown"
        Terminates the component.

OUTPUT EVENTS
    An event will be triggered for each new CPAN upload. The event will have
    ARG0 set to the path of the upload:

      B/BI/BINGOS/POE-Component-SmokeBox-Uploads-RSS-0.01.tar.gz

    Suitable for feeding to the smoke tester of your choice.
